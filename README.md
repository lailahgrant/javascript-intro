# JAVASCRIPPT INTRO
`Introduction topics to JavaScript`

> Prerequisites
>- Understanding of HTML and CSS

> What is JavaScript?
> It is a :
> - Client-Side Scripting Language - JS is executed only on the client-side (no server execution) [everything will execute on the client and the performance will be better.]
> - It is interpreted by browser's javascript engine.
>   -  e.g how's HTML runs on  browsers?
>       - Every browser has a `parser` which read the HTML tags and renders the text accordingly.
>   - What of JS?
>       - Every browser has a JS Engine e.g Chrome has a V8 engine, etc.
> - It is `untyped`, multi paradigm, functional, event driven. [untyped - no datatype specification needed on variable creation.] [functional - can split code into modular, make code into many functions to be used when needed].

> Advantages of JavaScript
> - Less Server interactions.
> - Better performance.
> - Increased Interactivity.
> - Richer interface.
